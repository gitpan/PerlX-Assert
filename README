NAME
    PerlX::Assert - yet another assertion keyword

SYNOPSIS
       use PerlX::Assert;
   
       assert { 1 >= 10 };

DESCRIPTION
    PerlX::Assert is a framework for embedding assertions in Perl code. Under
    normal circumstances, assertions are not checked; they are optimized away
    at compile time.

    However if, at compile time, any of the following environment variables is
    true, assertions are checked, and if they fail, throw an exception.

    *   `PERL_STRICT`

    *   `AUTHOR_TESTING`

    *   `EXTENDED_TESTING`

    *   `RELEASE_TESTING`

    That is, assertions will only typically be checked when the test suite is
    being run on the authors' machine, or otherwise opted into.

    The exact decision logic can be found in Devel::StrictMode.

    You can also force assertions to be checked using:

       use PerlX::Assert -check;

    There are four syntaxes for expressing assertions:

       assert EXPR;
       assert { BLOCK };
       assert "name", EXPR;
       assert "name" { BLOCK };

    Assertions can be named, which is probably a good idea because this module
    (and the rest of Moops) screws up Perl's reporting of line numbers. Names
    must be a quoted string (single or double quotes, or the `q` or `qq`
    quote-like operators); general expressions are not supported because
    Text::Balanced is used to parse the assertion name. An assertion is a
    statement, so must be followed by a semicolon unless it's the last
    statement in a block.

    PerlX::Assert was originally distributed as part of Moops, but was fairly
    independent of the rest of it, and has been spun off as a separate
    release, and backported to Perl 5.8.1.

    Assertions that span multiple lines are very likely to cause problems on
    versions of Perl prior to 5.12. If the `assert` keyword, the entire name,
    and the start of the expression or block are all on the same line, this
    should be sufficient.
